# Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI

This repo contains two [colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)
notebooks which accompany the paper, available online at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x

Both the representation theory and knot theory colabs retrain an ML model from
scratch and recreate our published results by our same intermediary steps.

## Installation

No installation is required; simply open the `.ipynb` via the `File` --> `Open
notebook` option directly from
[Github](https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_conjectures) or from a copy
stored locally or in Google Drive.

## Usage

Once the notebook has loaded, simply follow the comments along and execute all
of the cells from top to bottom.
